## Collaborative Filtering: Matrix Factorization vs Neural Networks


This was the main project for the course 'Algorithms for Data Science'. <br>

The selected paper is https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09683v2. <br>

The first part of the project was about making a clear presentation of the selected paper. The presentation is Petrakis_Konstantinos_presentation.pdf. <br>

In the second part i had to write an extensive report about the selected field. I had to study all the recent advances and capture clearly the current state of the art in the field. This report is Report_Petrakis_Konstantinos.pdf.
